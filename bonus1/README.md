# Ghana Transport Dataset Exploration Workshop

## Overview

This workshop explores the GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) dataset for Accra, Ghana's public transport system. The dataset contains comprehensive information about routes, stops, schedules, and agencies operating in Accra during May-June 2015.

## Dataset Structure

The GTFS dataset consists of several key files:

### Core Files:

- **agency.txt**: Transport agencies and operators (93 agencies)
- **routes.txt**: Bus routes with IDs and names (653 routes)
- **stops.txt**: Bus stops with coordinates (2,566 stops)
- **trips.txt**: Individual trips for each route (653 trips)
- **stop_times.txt**: Detailed timing for each stop (4,797 stop times)
- **shapes.txt**: Geographic route shapes (2.7MB of coordinate data)
- **calendar.txt**: Service schedules
- **fare_attributes.txt** & **fare_rules.txt**: Pricing information

### Key Insights:

- **93 transport agencies** operating in Accra
- **653 unique routes** connecting different parts of the city
- **2,566 bus stops** with GPS coordinates
- **4,797 stop times** showing detailed schedules
- **Route types**: All routes are type 3 (bus service)

## Workshop Objectives

1. **Dataset Exploration**: Understand the structure and relationships
2. **Problem Identification**: Identify real-world transport optimization challenges
3. **AI Implementation**: Build PyTorch models for transport analysis
4. **Practical Applications**: Demonstrate actionable insights for city planning

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install torch pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn folium
```

### Quick Start

```bash
python dataset_explorer.py
python route_optimizer.py
```

## Real-World Problems to Solve

### 1. Route Optimization

**Problem**: Minimize travel time and distance while maximizing coverage
**Approach**:

- Use PyTorch to model route efficiency
- Implement genetic algorithms for route optimization
- Consider traffic patterns and passenger demand

### 2. Stop Clustering and Consolidation

**Problem**: Too many stops causing delays and inefficiency
**Approach**:

- Use K-means clustering on stop coordinates
- Analyze passenger flow patterns
- Identify redundant stops for consolidation

### 3. Demand Prediction

**Problem**: Predict passenger demand at different times and locations
**Approach**:

- Time series analysis of stop_times.txt
- Weather and event correlation
- Seasonal pattern recognition

### 4. Service Frequency Optimization

**Problem**: Optimize bus frequency based on demand
**Approach**:

- Analyze headways in stop_times.txt
- Model passenger wait times
- Balance service frequency with operational costs

### 5. Accessibility Analysis

**Problem**: Identify underserved areas
**Approach**:

- Calculate coverage areas for each stop
- Identify gaps in service
- Propose new routes or stops

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Dataset Loading

```python
import pandas as pd
import torch
import numpy as np

# Load core datasets
routes = pd.read_csv('dataset/routes.txt')
stops = pd.read_csv('dataset/stops.txt')
stop_times = pd.read_csv('dataset/stop_times.txt')
trips = pd.read_csv('dataset/trips.txt')
agency = pd.read_csv('dataset/agency.txt')
```

### Route Efficiency Model

```python
class RouteEfficiencyModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = torch.nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = torch.nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
        self.relu = torch.nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        return self.fc2(x)
```

### Stop Clustering

```python
def cluster_stops(stops_df, n_clusters=50):
    coordinates = stops_df[['stop_lat', 'stop_lon']].values
    # Use PyTorch for clustering
    # Implementation details in the code files
```

## Key Metrics to Track

1. **Route Efficiency**: Average travel time per route
2. **Coverage**: Percentage of population within walking distance
3. **Reliability**: On-time performance
4. **Accessibility**: Distance to nearest stop
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Revenue per kilometer

## Next Steps

1. Run the dataset explorer to understand the data
2. Implement the route optimization model
3. Build demand prediction system
4. Create visualization dashboard
5. Deploy for real-time analysis

## Files in this Workshop

- `dataset_explorer.py`: Comprehensive dataset analysis
- `route_optimizer.py`: PyTorch-based route optimization
- `demand_predictor.py`: Passenger demand prediction model
- `visualization.py`: Interactive maps and charts
- `utils.py`: Helper functions and data processing

## Tips for Hackathon Participants

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic data exploration
2. **Focus on Impact**: Choose problems with clear real-world applications
3. **Validate Assumptions**: Test your models with real data
4. **Consider Constraints**: Account for road conditions, vehicle capacity
5. **Think Deployment**: How will your solution be used by transport authorities?
